```javascript
let x = 5 + 3  // whole line is statement

// 5+3  <-- expression
```

# Expression
* it will turn out to be a single value


```javascript
let x = 6 + 4
let y = x + 2
let z = (y + 4) * 3  
let a = z
```

# What is
* Statement = whole line
* Expression = what is present in right side of the equal '='
* Expression can be evaluated as a single value
* Single variable/value is also an expression

# Remember the `if()` syntax
```javascript
if (expression) {
  statement;
} else if (expression) {
  statement;
} else {
  statement;
}
```
