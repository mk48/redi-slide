title: 'Passing a function as an argument to another function'

* In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens
* This means you can treat them like any other variable.
* You can:
    * Assign them to variables.
    * Pass them as arguments to other functions.
    * Return them from other functions.

```javascript
function applyOperation(num1, num2, operation) {
  return operation(num1, num2);
}

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}

console.log(applyOperation(5, 3, add)); // Output: 8
console.log(applyOperation(5, 3, subtract)); // Output: 2
```
