# Who reviews your home work? 🧛‍♀️
* You have to generate the home work submission list
* Randomly assign students to teachers
* You have students and teachers array below
* save the result in a array of objects `[ {...}, {...}, {...} ]`
* print the result in console.log()
* once your code works then manually include one more student in the array list, (just type a new student name in the array list)
* then, run the program, it should still assign properly
* then try to include one more teacher; still, the program should work. 🙂

# Tips
* shuffle students array
* shuffle teachers array
* pick first student, pick first teacher and assign them.

```javascript
const students = ["s1", "s2", "s3"];
const teachers = ["t1", "t2"];

//*** your code here ***

//expected output
//
// [ 
//   {student: "s1", teacher : "t2"},
//   {student: "s2", teacher : "t2"},
//   {student: "s3", teacher : "t1"},
// ]
```
