- Arrays are **ordered collections** of data
- Used to store multiple values in a single variable
- Can hold any type of data (numbers, strings, objects, even other arrays)
- Zero-indexed (first element is at position 0)

```javascript
// Creating arrays
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let mixed = [42, "hello", true, { name: "John" }];
```
