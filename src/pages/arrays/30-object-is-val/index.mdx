# everything is object

```javascript
let x = 5 // 5 is a value
let a = [6, 0, 4, 8] // all are values
```

# everything is value (just another name) ðŸ˜‘
* array elements are values
* the whole array is also a value
* object is a value


```javascript
let x = [value1, value2, value3, value4] 
let y = value5
let z = {name: value6}
```

# Replace value1, 2, 3, 4 with any value
* remember everything is value

```javascript
//object can be a value inside array
let x = [5, "green", 9.9, false, {name: "kumaran"} ]

//array can be a value inside object
let z = {name: [6, 7, 1]}

//array can be a value inside array
let a = [8, 9, [78, 54], 5]

//object can be inside an object
let y = {name: "Sony", fav: { food: "Rice", color : "Red" } }
```
